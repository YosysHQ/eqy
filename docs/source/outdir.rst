EQY Output Directory Format
===========================

Log and status file
-------------------

The EQY terminal output is also written to the file ``logfile.txt``
in the output directory.

Further, when the EQY run succeeded, a file ``PASS`` is created
in the output directory, and a file ``FAIL`` is generated otherwise.

Gate and gold designs
---------------------

The file ``gold.il`` contains the compiled gold design. The log
for compiling it is written to ``gold.log`` and the yosys
script compiling it is ``gold.ys``. Finally, the list of
gold entities going into the matching algorithm is stored
in ``gold.ids``.

Similarly there are ``gate.il``, ``gate.log``, ``gate.ys``,
and ``gate.ids``.

Combined gold and gate designs
------------------------------

EQY stores a "combined" gold and gate design, that contains
all modules from the gold design, their names prefixed with ``gold_``,
and all modules from the gate design, using the ``gate_`` name
prefix.

The combined design is stored in the output file ``combined.il``.
The script that performs the task of combining the gold and
gate designs is stored in ``combine.ys``, and the log messages
generated by that script are stored in ``combine.log``.

The combine operation partially flattens the gold and gate designs,
so that the hierarchies of both designs match, thus getting to a
state of matching module names in both design hierarchies.

Matched gold and gate names
---------------------------

The list of matched gold and gate entity names is stored in
the file ``matched.ids``. Each line of this file contains
a module name, followed by a gold net name, followed by
a gate net name.

Design partition files
----------------------

The file ``partition.ids`` contains flags on gold module and net names,
generated from the ``[partition ...]`` configuration sections. These
flags guide the partition generation algorithm.

The file ``partition.list`` contains a list of all generated design partitions,
and the primary inputs and primary outputs of each such partition.

The file ``partition.ys`` contains the script running the partitioning
algorithm, and the file ``partition.log`` contains the log output
from running that script.

Finally, the ``partitions/`` directory contains the generated partitions,
one file for each partition, each file containing a ``gold_`` and a ``gate_``
module.

Strategies input and output files
---------------------------------

The directory ``strategies/`` contains a sub-directory for each partition,
and a sub-sub-directory for each strategy applied to that partition.

Each of those sub-sub-directories contains a ``run.sh`` script that will
run the strategy, and a ``run.log`` script with the log output from running
that script.

Lastly, a file ``status`` is generated when the strategy is being run,
and the first word in that file is ``PASS`` when the strategy proved the
partition to be equivalent successfully. The other possible status values for a
strategy are ``UNKNOWN``, ``FAIL``, and ``ERROR``.

The file ``strategies.mk`` is a Makefile that runs all the strategies
within the ``strategies/`` directory.
